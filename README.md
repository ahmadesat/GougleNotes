# Description
This was just a practice project that I did to remember React.js properly.
It was fun to do, and you are free to copy it or use it as you wish.

## To run the app:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
